# Boardification

[My Notes](notes.md)

A simple web application to turn anything quantifiable into a contest. Leaderboards can be created, titled, and have scores submitted to them by users. Boards can be opened and closed by users, and can be seen by anyone invited to the same board.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever needed a place to keep track of your competition with all your friends? Boardification is the answer. On Boardification, you can create a leader board (or "boardify") for anything you can think of. Most cookies made in a day? Highest streak of wins in Chess? Number of leaderboards won? Boardify has you covered. Just sign up for an account, boardify your contest, and invite your friends to join the board. Now it's easy to see who's #1.
